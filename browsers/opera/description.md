Opera traces its history back to the mid-1990s and has evolved from a proprietary, Presto-based browser to a Chromium-based product using the Blink engine. The browser is now owned by a Chinese consortium led by Beijing Kunlun Tech, which acquired Opera Software ASA in 2016. Today's desktop and mobile Opera browsers emphasize built-in capabilities such as an ad blocker, integrated VPN/proxy, and messaging sidebars on top of Chromium's core functionality.

### Market Position

Opera is a cross-platform consumer browser with a modest share of the global desktop and mobile market. It targets users who value integrated features like VPN/proxy, ad blocking, and social integrations without additional extensions. There is no formal "Opera for Enterprise" product or dedicated enterprise marketing program.

### Technical Foundation

Opera's modern browsers are based on Chromium and inherit multi-process design, sandboxing, and Blink's rendering behavior. Opera also maintains its own extension ecosystem and private browser APIs, which has been the focus of security research showing potential extension abuse paths when API permissions are misconfigured.

### Enterprise Adoption

Opera does not publish a dedicated enterprise deployment and policy reference. Community discussions show administrators deploying Opera using MSI or EXE installers via Group Policy, Intune, and other software distribution tools, treating it as a standard Windows application. Features such as the built-in VPN are not designed for central enterprise control.
