Comet is an AI-native browser developed by Perplexity AI and officially announced in July 2025 as the company's first browser product. Built on Chromium, Comet aims to turn the browser from a passive rendering surface into an active assistant that can understand pages, execute tasks, and automate workflows. Initial releases targeted Windows and macOS, with Android following, and early access distribution focused on a limited user base before broader rollout.

### Market Position

Comet positions itself as a personal AI assistant in browser form, targeting power users, knowledge workers, and early-adopter enterprises who want AI tightly integrated into daily browsing. It enters a market dominated by mainstream Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) and emerging AI browsers, differentiating on the depth of agentic automation and Perplexity's search-centric capabilities. As of late 2025, Comet remains a newcomer with a comparatively small user base, and enterprise adoption is largely in exploratory or pilot stages.

### Technical Foundation

Comet is based on Chromium and uses the Blink engine, maintaining compatibility with Chrome extensions and modern web standards while adding an AI orchestration layer. Its architecture integrates conversational AI directly into the browser, enabling the agent to read and summarize current pages, maintain context across tabs, and perform multi-step actions such as filling forms, organizing tabs, and interacting with email and calendar services.

### Enterprise Adoption

Perplexity markets Comet to enterprises as part of Perplexity Enterprise, highlighting speed, data-tight configurations, and AI-enabled workflows integrated with corporate sources. Public enterprise-oriented materials focus on agentic productivity and integration with email, calendars, and knowledge systems rather than on a detailed browser policy catalog or admin console. Comet's suitability for broad enterprise deployment depends heavily on the organization's ability to manage AI-related risks: prompt injection, agent hijacking, and data governance, using external controls and Perplexity's enterprise configurations.
