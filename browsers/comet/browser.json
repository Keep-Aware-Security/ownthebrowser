    "summary": "Comet exposes an AI-first browsing model with enterprise-focused messaging via Perplexity Enterprise, but current large-scale deployments require strong surrounding identity, DLP, and security controls rather than relying on a mature browser-native management stack.",

    "caution_scenarios": [
      "Enterprises with strict SSO-boundary and session-confidentiality requirements, where an agent that can read and act across authenticated tabs creates unacceptable lateral-movement and data-exfiltration risk.",
