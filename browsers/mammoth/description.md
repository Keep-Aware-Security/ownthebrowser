Mammoth Enterprise Browser is a Chromium-based enterprise browser built by Mammoth Cyber to make the browser the enforcement point for zero-trust access, DLP, and generative AI governance. The product evolved from Mammoth's earlier secure access work and now targets the rapidly growing need to control SaaS, BYOD access, and GenAI usage via browser-native policy rather than traditional agents and network appliances. Mammoth is positioned as an enterprise AI browser that combines policy enforcement, secure remote access, and AI-aware controls in a single client.

### Market Position

Mammoth targets security-conscious enterprises dealing with remote work, contractors, and shadow AI, particularly where SaaS and GenAI tools are central to daily workflows. Vendor messaging emphasizes that the browser is the new control point, framing Mammoth as a way to instrument and govern that surface while reducing reliance on VDI and heavy network-security chains. Mammoth competes with Island and similar enterprise browsers by focusing on AI-aware DLP, BYOD coverage, and policy enforcement for both human users and AI agents.

### Technical Foundation

Mammoth's Enterprise Browser is a Chromium-based solution with a policy engine integrated directly into the browser layer, allowing real-time control over data actions such as downloads, uploads, clipboard, print, screen share, and session recording. The platform enforces zero-trust access by combining browser sessions with identity and device posture, supporting role- and posture-based policy decisions and session isolation for sensitive workflows, including GenAI interactions. Mammoth supports private-model AI and bring-your-own-model (BYOM) scenarios, enabling organizations to route sensitive prompts to internal LLMs while blocking unapproved external models.

### Enterprise Adoption

Mammoth is marketed exclusively as an enterprise product, with desktop and mobile browsers for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, plus browser-native governance for BYOD and contractor access without requiring MDM on personal devices. Use cases highlighted by the vendor include secure mobile access, secure AI adoption, VDI reduction, and zero-trust access for unmanaged devices and distributed workforces.
