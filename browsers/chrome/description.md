Google Chrome launched in September 2008 and rapidly transformed the browser landscape. Built on the open-source Chromium project, Chrome introduced a multi-process architecture that isolated tabs for improved stability and security, a design that has since become the industry standard.

### Market Dominance

Chrome commands approximately **65% of the global desktop browser market**, making it the de facto standard for web development and enterprise deployment. This dominance means most web applications are built and tested against Chrome first, ensuring maximum compatibility.

### The Chromium Foundation

Chrome's open-source foundation powers numerous other browsers including Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. This means security vulnerabilities and patches often affect the broader browser ecosystem, and Chrome typically receives fixes first.

### Enterprise Adoption

For enterprise IT teams, Chrome represents the path of least resistance. Its mature policy framework, extensive documentation, and integration with Google Workspace make it a natural choice for organizations already invested in Google's ecosystem. However, this convenience comes with considerations around data privacy and vendor dependency that security teams must evaluate.
