Prisma Access Browser is Palo Alto Networks' SASE-native secure enterprise browser that embeds threat prevention, DLP, and zero-trust controls directly into a custom Chromium build. It is designed to extend Prisma SASE policies and cloud-delivered security services to the browser itself, turning every session into a controlled workspace for SaaS, web, private apps, and even remote protocols such as SSH and RDP.

### Market Position

Prisma Access Browser is positioned as the only secure browser natively integrated into a full SASE framework, marketed as the missing piece of SASE in Prisma SASE 3.0. It targets enterprises that already depend on Palo Alto for NGFW, Prisma Access, and Enterprise DLP, and want browser security, data protection, and GenAI controls to be part of a unified fabric rather than a standalone enterprise browser.

### Technical Foundation

The browser is a custom Chromium build that supports Chrome-compatible extensions while embedding Palo Alto Cloud-Delivered Security Services (CDSS) such as Advanced URL Filtering, Threat Prevention, Advanced WildFire, Enterprise DLP, and PrecisionAI-driven detections. Prisma Browser extends zero-trust policies from the network to the last mile, enforcing context-based controls per user, app, device posture, location, and network, and leveraging more than 1,000 data classifiers and LLM-enhanced detectors for content- and context-aware DLP without decrypting traffic.

### Enterprise Adoption

Palo Alto positions Prisma Browser as a core part of Prisma SASE for use cases including VDI reduction, BYOD and contractor access, secure GenAI usage, and protection against threats hidden in encrypted traffic and unmanaged browsers. Customer stories highlight adoption to replace or avoid VDI, accelerate M&A onboarding, and standardize secure browser-based access while taking advantage of existing Prisma Access infrastructure and Strata Cloud Manager policy workflows.
