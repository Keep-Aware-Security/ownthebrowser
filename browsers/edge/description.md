Microsoft Edge was reintroduced in 2015 as the successor to Internet Explorer and later rebuilt on the open-source Chromium project, with the Chromium-based version becoming generally available in January 2020. The current Edge for Business experience positions the browser as a work-focused variant that automatically separates work and personal browsing contexts while retaining a shared underlying codebase.

### Market Position

Edge has grown into a major desktop browser, typically holding a high single- to low double-digit percentage of global desktop market share, driven largely by its role as the default browser on Windows and its integration with Microsoft 365 services. For enterprises already standardized on Windows, Microsoft 365, or Entra ID, Edge for Business is positioned as the default choice, and Microsoft explicitly markets it as a "secure enterprise AI browser."

### Technical Foundation

Edge's Chromium foundation means it shares the Blink rendering engine, multi-process sandboxing, and extension model common to other Chromium-based browsers, with Microsoft layering its own security features, policies, and AI integrations on top. Microsoft documents sandbox controls such as `NetworkServiceSandboxEnabled`, indicating that key browser services run in restricted processes by default. The browser also incorporates Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, automatic HTTPS upgrades, and continuous threat intelligence feeds from Microsoft's broader security ecosystem.

### Enterprise Adoption

For enterprise IT, Edge for Business is framed as a managed work browser tied to Microsoft Entra ID, Intune, and Defender, with a dedicated Edge management service exposed through the Microsoft 365 admin center. Microsoft provides a full enterprise documentation set covering deployment, policy configuration, security, and privacy, with hundreds of configurable policies available via Group Policy, MDM, and cloud-based Edge management.
