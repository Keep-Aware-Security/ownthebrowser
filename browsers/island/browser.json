    "summary": "Island is designed from the outset as a managed enterprise browser with centralized policy, integrated DLP and ZTNA, and deep logging, but its agentless, browser-centric approach concentrates access, security, and user experience control in a single vendor platform.",
    "best_fit_scenarios": [
      "Enterprises that want the browser to be the primary enforcement point for zero-trust access to SaaS and internal web apps, replacing or reducing reliance on VDI and legacy VPN for day-to-day knowledge work.",

    "caution_scenarios": [
      "Organizations aiming to keep the browser as a relatively thin client with minimal vendor lock-in, where centralizing access, DLP, ZTNA, and logging in one proprietary browser platform conflicts with architectural or procurement strategy.",
      "Enterprises that prefer a multi-browser environment or face internal resistance to mandating a single vendor-specific browser as the exclusive tool for all web-based work.",
      "Use cases that rely heavily on non-web workloads, thick-client applications, or highly customized browser engines where Island's web-centric control model does not cover all critical interaction surfaces.",
      "Environments where security and audit programs require direct visibility into and control over all control points (for example, independent network DLP, SWG, and EDR) and may resist moving core detection and enforcement logic into a vendor-managed browser."
