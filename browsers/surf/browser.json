    "summary": "Chromium-based zero-trust enterprise browser and extension that turns the browser itself into the secure endpoint, aiming to replace or reduce VPN, VDI, CASB, SWG, and some endpoint agents by enforcing granular DLP and threat-prevention policies on both managed and unmanaged devices.",

    "summary": "SURF is purpose-built as a zero-trust enterprise browser and extension for managed and unmanaged endpoints, with strong in-browser threat prevention, DLP, and posture checks, but it centralizes controls in a vendor platform that will sit alongside or displace existing VPN/VDI/CASB/SWG tooling.",
    "best_fit_scenarios": [
      "Organizations seeking to simplify or replace complex VPN, VDI, CASB, SWG, and RBI stacks by converging web, SaaS, and on-prem app access into a browser-centric zero-trust access model.",
      "Enterprises with large distributed or contractor/BYOD workforces that need granular DLP, posture checks, and session monitoring on unmanaged devices without MDM or hardware-based endpoint security.",
      "Security teams that want full visibility over browser activity, what apps are used, what data is accessed and moved, and how users authenticate, plus session/DLP recording to strengthen insider-threat and compliance programs."
    ],
    "caution_scenarios": [
      "Environments that prefer a lighter-touch browser where VPN, ZTNA, CASB, and SWG remain separate, and where consolidating enforcement into one browser platform conflicts with procurement or risk-distribution strategy.",
      "Enterprises that prefer a multi-browser environment or face internal resistance to mandating a single, less-established browser as the exclusive tool for all web-based work.",
      "Use cases heavily dependent on rich desktop apps or protocols outside HTTP(S), where a browser-centric model alone cannot fully replace VDI or endpoint controls.",
      "Organizations already standardized on another enterprise browser tightly integrated into an existing SASE stack may face overlap and will need to rationalize where SURF's zero-trust browser fits in their architecture."
