          "Atlas inherits Chromium's sandboxing and site compatibility but adds browser memory and agent mode, giving ChatGPT broad visibility into browsing activity and the ability to take actions within logged-in sites.",
          "OpenAI's safety design for agent mode blocks code execution in the browser, file downloads, extension installation, and access to other apps or the file system, and requires user oversight on certain sensitive sites, but these safeguards do not eliminate prompt-injection or URL-based agent hijacking risks.",
          "Agentic browsers like Atlas are vulnerable to prompt injection and malicious URLs that can trick the agent into unintended actions, and browser memory creates persistent behavioral profiles that raise privacy and data-exposure risk."

          "Early reviews describe Atlas as generally stable for everyday browsing, with integrated ChatGPT and dual views of AI answers plus raw search results functioning as expected.",
          "Because agent behavior and browser memory rely on evolving models and cloud services, reliability of AI tasks can change over time, and enterprises should expect non-deterministic behavior and occasional regressions in complex agent flows."

          "Atlas must continuously capture page state, composite UI elements, and send context to ChatGPT for agent mode and browser memory, which introduces extra CPU, memory, and network overhead compared to a non-agentic browser.",

          "Agent mode lets users delegate tasks (for example, filling forms, booking appointments, navigating sites) and receive contextual suggestions based on current and past browsing, reducing context switching.",
          "Users must understand when the agent is acting, how browser memory tracks their behavior, and how to disable or constrain agent mode, which adds cognitive overhead and requires user education in enterprise deployments."

          "Some complex or security-sensitive workflows may not behave as expected when the agent is active, and OpenAI explicitly limits automated actions on certain financial or highly sensitive sites, which may constrain automation in enterprise applications."
