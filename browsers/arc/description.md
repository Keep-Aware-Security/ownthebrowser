Arc began as a macOS-only browser from The Browser Company, opening to the public in 2022 with a focus on rethinking browser UX around a sidebar, Spaces, and built-in creative tools like Easels and Boosts. It later expanded to iOS and then to Windows, where a native WinUI-based client brought Arc's interface to Windows 11. In late 2024, The Browser Company announced it was shifting focus toward new AI-powered browser products, effectively placing Arc in maintenance mode with no planned major feature development.

### Market Position

Arc targeted design- and workflow-focused individual users and small teams rather than enterprise deployments. It gained a visible but niche user base among macOS and creative professionals, with Windows support arriving later with partial feature parity. With the vendor's pivot away from Arc, its position is now that of a completed experiment in browser UX rather than an evolving product.

### Technical Foundation

Arc is built on Chromium, using the Blink engine and inheriting Chromium's multi-process architecture, sandboxing, and web standards support. The vendor's security documentation states that Arc uses Google Cloud Firebase for user authentication and storage for Notes and Easels, with data encrypted at rest. Arc's signature features include Spaces for organizing groups of tabs and accounts, vertical sidebar navigation, split views, and rich theming.

### Enterprise Adoption

Arc was never positioned as an enterprise browser and lacks the policy surface and management tooling expected in large organizations. Community reports indicate that some enterprises explicitly disallowed Arc because it did not support enterprise security management features available in mainstream browsers. The Browser Company published limited information on group policies, primarily plist-based settings on macOS, but there is no ADMX policy catalog or dedicated management console. Given the product's maintenance-mode status, these enterprise capabilities are unlikely to be expanded.
